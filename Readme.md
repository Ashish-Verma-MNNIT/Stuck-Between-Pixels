## Introduction:
  *We are implementing an Eco-friendly certification dApp.* 
  - The dApp allows businesses and individuals to certify their products or services as environmentally friendly by providing proof of their sustainability, ethical sourcing, and responsible production practices.
 - The certification process is typically based on a set of pre-defined criteria that assess the environmental impact of a product or service. 
These criteria may include factors such as energy efficiency, carbon emissions, waste reduction, and sustainable sourcing of raw materials.
- To obtain a certification, businesses and individuals need to provide evidence of compliance with these criteria, which is then verified by a decentralized network of validators.
